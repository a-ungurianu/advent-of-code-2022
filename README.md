Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to this year's competition.

No peeking :)

Build & run
-----

If you want to run this project, make sure you have [rebar3](http://www.rebar3.org/) installed.
It's the de-facto toolchain for Erlang nowadays, so you really shouldn't be using anything else.


    $ rebar3 escriptize
    $ set -m && clear && _build/default/bin/aoc21
